# Volumio Node Server (c) 2021 Robert Paauwe

This is a node server to interface a [Volumio](http://www.volumio.org) Music player with
[Universal Devices ISY994] (https://www.universal-devices.com/residential/ISY) series of
controllers. It is written to run under the
[Polyglot interface](http://www.universal-devices.com/developers/polyglot/docs/) with
[Polyglot V2](https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-polyglotv2)

Volumio is music server software designed to run on lightweight hardware like a Raspberry Pi.
It can play music from multiple sources including a local hard drive, a NAS, music servers,
Internet radio stations, Pandora, Spotify, etc.

This node server allows an ISY to have basic control over the music player. It queries the
Volumio device for the configured sources so that the ISY can choose which source to play.
Play, Pause, Next, Previous playback controls are supported. The ability to adjust the volume
level, turn repeat and shuffle on/off is also available.
